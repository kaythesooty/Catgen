# Catgen!

## A web tool for managing Clangen cats

Currently in alpha, Catgen will help with generating and customising cats for Clangen. Choose from all the available options for fur colour, length, pattern, eye colours, lore, and more. Then save your cat as an image or export the .json data so you can load your cat into your clan.
